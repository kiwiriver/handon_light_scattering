* compile file
The source file in /src folder can be compiled and run through
%./build_sh. An ouput folder will be created at the same time. 

* example file
A few examples are included in /example with figures and code to make
plots. 

radiance.dat is the data of the diffuse radiance from the Monte Carlo
simulation. It can be plotted by using
%python ../plot_radiance.py

trajectory.dat is the data of the photon trajectories. The data can be
used to debug the code and visulize the photon path. The data columns are
defined as follows:
photon index number, collision index number, photon weight, photon
position x, y, z
