Code for studying the successive order of scattering. 
This code is modified from the Monte Carlo code for radiative
transfer of a Ralyeigh scattering medium. The order of scattering is
tracked and constrained in this modified code. User can modified the
maxium number of scatterings in the source code
(MonteCarloRayleigh_SOS.f90) 

* compile and run
In source code folder /src
% ./build.sh

* example files are included in /example
with different optical depths and different number of scattering
orders 
* plot graph in /example
in the data folder run 
%python ../plot_radiance.py
