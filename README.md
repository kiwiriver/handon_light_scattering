# Basic scattering methods for radiative transfer simulations

Radiative transfer simulation is fundamental for the study of energy budget in atmospheric and oceanic system. It is also the core for the satellite remote sensing applications. The simulations require the knowledge of the single scattering properties from individual particles, and can provide the diffuse reflected and transmitted radiance from the multiple scattering among a collection of the particles.

In this package, we demonstrate the basic concepts and numerical simulation methods for both single and multiple scattering methods including the 2D geometrical ray tracing method, and the Monte Carlo radiative transfer method. The Monte Carlo code is also extended to discuss the method of sucessive orders of scattering (SOS).

Both numerical source codes and examples are included.  Anyone interested are encouraged to handon experiment with the numerical codes to explore the underlying law that governs the nature of light scattering.

## Numerical Methods
